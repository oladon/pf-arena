This is a little game I made to demonstrate the textengine project, which is a 
digital implementation of the Pathfinder RPG rules set. In PF Arena, the player 
begins as a bat (Bestiary 1, CR 1/8) and fights his way up through the Bestiary 
monsters, having the option to take on a fallen opponent's form if desired.

NOTE: You won't be able to actually run this code, as it requires the textengine
project, which is not yet publically available.
